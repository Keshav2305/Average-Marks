# Average-Marks
A code displaying average marks out of 5 subjects and printing a grade corresponding to the average marks.
## How it works
The variables are initialzed first and we take inputs for the array that holds individual marks of individual subjects.
Then we add all those marks and  put them another variable and divide them by 5 to get the average. And we print the grade equal to the average.
## Explaination
Now if the average is above or equal to 90, the grade is printed out to be O. If the average is in between 79 and 89, the grade is A+. IN the same way the , if average is in between 89 and 85, grade is A, if average is in between 84 and 75, grade is B+, if average is between 74 and 65, grade is B, if average is between 65 and 55, the grade is Justt pass+, else we print fail.
